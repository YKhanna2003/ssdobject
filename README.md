**SSD (Single Shot Detector) Object Detection Algorithm**

This repository shows the implementation of the SSD Object Algorithm. Also, you can see or test the algorithm code with different videos present in the repository.
The Requirements include:
    **OpenCV: Command**- pip install opencv-python
    **MatPlotlib: Command**- pip install matplotlib
  
You can open the folder using **Jupyter Notebook** and run the **ssdimplementation.ipynb** to see the Algorithm in action.

**Cheers!**

Here is the photo of the code in running:
